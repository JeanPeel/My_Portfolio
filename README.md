# My Portfolio

This is a webpage built in react using bootstrap and CSS.  It shows a portfolio of my coding projects including an about me page, contact information, resume, and even a future blog.  It is a one stop shop for me to show my self branding and build my profile of my skills and atributes.

## About this project

This project is intended to display information about myself and my branding.  This project can be duplicated by someone who is interested in building themselves something smilar.

## Application Use
The app is a multipule page React Application. The user lands on the Home Page where they can navigate to an about me page, contact information, resume, and even a future blog.

## Tech Used
* React.js
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* Javascript
* Heroku
* CSS
* React-Router-Dom
* React-Alert

## Details of App and Challenges
The CSS uses media calls based on the size of the screen.  It is a little tangled and unclear at this time.  In future versions I would like to untangle the CSS and make it more clear.  In the middle I ran into an unknown CSS problem.  I took apart the whole page one item at a time and rebuilt it, and did not find the problem.  So I moved forward with putting items into imperfect pages.  As I did this I found the different nuanced tangled CSS elements that produce results differently then intended.  At some point in the future the project would benefit from reorganizing the CSS and untangeling the overlap of media call interactions.

### Prerequisites

The Libraries on this project are Bootstrap CSS and Script links, Jquery links, there is a Popper link also on the main html page but I hav enot used this yet.  

The dependencies on this project are React, React Bootstrap, Express, Npde Lodash. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
examples...
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

## Deployment

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
